                        <p>My binnamma!, you're a total angel, seriously. Recently, you faced some tough stuff, 
                        but man, did you fight like a champ. 
                        You were like a superheroâ€”so strong, I wouldn't 
                        believe it if I didn't see it. 
                        When I'm dealing with my own mess, you're my go-to. 
                        Always there with a comforting shoulder when I need a good cry.
                        And let me tell you, you're more mature than half the folks your age. 
                        It's crazy. Whenever you're up to something, 
                        you spill all the deets with me. 
                        Like, you're my partner in crime, no secrets between us. 
                        Sometimes, you get a bit stubborn, 
                        but honestly, it just adds to your cuteness. 
                        I'm lucky to have a sister like you, someone who's been through the rough patches 
                        and still shines like an absolute star. 
                        Love you to bits! ðŸ’–âœ¨
